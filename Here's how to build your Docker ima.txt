 Here's how to build your Docker image and push it to your Azure Container Registry (schsbm-nrn-search.azurecr.io).


  Make sure you are in the root directory of your Django project (the directory containing your Dockerfile and manage.py) when you run these
  commands.


   1. Build Your Docker Image:
      This command builds the Docker image based on your Dockerfile. The -t nrnsearch-web assigns a tag (name) to your local image.


   1     docker build -t nrnsearch-web .



   2. Log in to Your Azure Container Registry:
      You need to authenticate Docker with your ACR.


   1     az acr login --name schsbm-nrn-search

      (This command uses the Azure CLI to get credentials and log Docker into your ACR. If you enabled admin credentials for your ACR, this should
   work seamlessly.)


   3. Tag Your Docker Image for ACR:
      You need to tag your local image with the full name of your ACR login server. This tells Docker where to push the image.



   1     docker tag nrnsearch-web:latest schsbm-nrn-search.azurecr.io/nrnsearch-web:latest


   4. Push the Tagged Image to Your Azure Container Registry:
      This command uploads your Docker image to your ACR.



   1     docker push schsbm-nrn-search.azurecr.io/nrnsearch-web:latest



  Once these commands complete successfully, your nrnsearch-web:latest image will be available in your schsbm-nrn-search Azure Container Registry.
   Then you can go back to the Azure Portal and select it in the "Image" and "Tag" fields.
