The most streamlined approach involves using Continuous Deployment (CD) directly from your source code repository, such as
  GitHub.

  Here's how it generally works, simplifying many of the manual Docker and Azure CLI steps:


   1. Prepare Your Django Application for Production (Same as before):
       * Ensure DEBUG = False in nrn_search/settings.py.
       * Update ALLOWED_HOSTS to include your Azure App Service domain.
       * Configure STATIC_ROOT and run python manage.py collectstatic.
       * Your Dockerfile should be ready for production (e.g., using Gunicorn).


   2. Push Your Code to a GitHub Repository:
       * Make sure your entire project, including the Dockerfile, is committed and pushed to a GitHub repository.


   3. Create Azure App Service (Web App for Containers):
       * In the Azure Portal, create a new "App Service".
       * When configuring, choose "Docker Container" as the publish method.
       * Select "Linux" as the operating system.
       * For the "Image Source", you'll eventually connect to your GitHub repository.


   4. Set up Continuous Deployment from GitHub:
       * Once your App Service is created, navigate to it in the Azure Portal.
       * Go to "Deployment Center" (or "Deployment slots" if you're using them).
       * Select "GitHub" as your source control.
       * Authorize Azure to access your GitHub account.
       * Choose your repository and the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., main or master).
       * Azure will detect your Dockerfile and automatically set up a GitHub Actions workflow. This workflow will:
           * Trigger on pushes to your selected branch.
           * Build your Docker image.
           * Push the image to a new or existing Azure Container Registry (ACR) that Azure automatically sets up for you.
           * Deploy the new image to your Azure App Service.


   5. Configure App Service Environment Variables:
       * In the Azure Portal, go to your App Service, then "Configuration" -> "Application settings".
       * Add your database connection strings (host, user, password, name) and Django's SECRET_KEY as environment variables. These are crucial
         for your Django app to connect to the database and run securely.


   6. Set up Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Still a separate step):
       * You'll still need to create and configure your Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server separately in the Azure Portal, as
         described in the previous detailed steps.
       * Ensure its firewall rules allow connections from your Azure App Service.


   7. Run Initial Migrations and Create Superuser:
       * After the first successful deployment via CD, you'll need to run your Django migrations and create a superuser. You can do this by
         connecting to your App Service's SSH console via the Azure Portal or Azure CLI.

  Benefits of this simpler approach:


   * Automation: Every time you push changes to your GitHub repository, Azure automatically builds and deploys your application.
   * Less Manual Intervention: You don't need to manually build Docker images, tag them, or push them to a registry yourself after the initial
     setup.
   * Integrated Workflow: Azure provides a seamless experience from code to deployment.


  This method significantly reduces the manual overhead compared to running individual Docker commands and Azure CLI commands for each
  deployment.
